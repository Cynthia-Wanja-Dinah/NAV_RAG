##PrepMate AI smart interview practice assistant
Prep AI is an intelligent interview preparation tool that helps job seekers practice effectively. By uploading a PDF with interview questions, users can interact with the app as if they were in a real interview. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide meaningful, context-based answers and guidance.

Advantages:

ðŸŽ¯ Personalized practice â€“ Users practice with their own .envinterview question sets.

ðŸ§  Realistic experience â€“ Mimics a Q&A session to boost confidence.

ðŸ“š Efficient learning â€“ Extracts knowledge from uploaded PDFs, saving time.

ðŸš€ Career-ready â€“ Builds communication, knowledge, and confidence for real interviews.

How it Works:

Upload â€“ User uploads a PDF containing interview questions.

Process â€“ The app extracts and embeds the content into a knowledge base.

Ask & Practice â€“ Users ask questions, and the RAG system retrieves relevant information from the PDF.

Answer & Feedback â€“ The AI responds with context-aware answers to simulate an interview session.
